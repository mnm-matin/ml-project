On the banks of the King River in the remote East Kimberley region of Western Australia, 
the tiny Aboriginal community of Kalumburu is leading the way in turtle conservation. 
For years, the town's people have been working to protect Olive Ridley turtles, 
which come to the area's beaches each year from Indonesia to lay their eggs. 
With the help of Indigenous rangers, the community has established a number of initiatives 
to protect the turtles, including a turtle monitoring program and a 
hatchery for eggs that are at risk of being disturbed or destroyed by feral pigs and other wildlife.
